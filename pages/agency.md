|  agency_id | Optional | The **agency_id** field is an ID that uniquely identifies a transit agency. A transit feed may represent data from more than one agency. The **agency_id** is dataset unique. This field is optional for transit feeds that only contain data for a single agency. |

|  agency_url | Required | The **agency_url** field contains the URL of the transit agency. The value must be a fully qualified URL that includes **http**:// or **https**://, and any special characters in the URL must be correctly escaped.
