|  ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  agency_id | Optional | The **agency_id** field is an ID that uniquely identifies a transit agency. A transit feed may represent data from more than one agency. The **agency_id** is dataset unique. This field is optional for transit feeds that only contain data for a single agency. |
|  agency_name | Required | The **agency_name** field contains the full name of the transit agency. Google Maps will display this name. |
|  agency_url | Required | The **agency_url** field contains the URL of the transit agency. The value must be a fully qualified URL that includes **http**:// or **https**://, and any special characters in the URL must be correctly escaped.

|  agency_timezone | Required | The **agency_timezone** field contains the timezone where the transit agency is located. Timezone names never contain the space character but may contain an underscore. Please refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_zones for a list of valid values. If multiple agencies are specified in the feed, each must have the same agency_timezone. |

Please refer to http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php for a list of valid values. |

This field is a string value that presents the telephone number as typical for the agency's service area. It can and should contain punctuation marks to group the digits of the number.
