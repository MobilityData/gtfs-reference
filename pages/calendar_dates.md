### calendar_dates.txt

File: **Optional**

The calendar_dates table allows you to explicitly activate or disable service IDs by date. You can use it in two ways.

* Recommended: Use calendar_dates.txt in conjunction with [calendar.txt](#calendartxt), where calendar_dates.txt defines any exceptions to the default service categories defined in the [calendar.txt](#calendartxt) file. If your service is generally regular, with a few changes on explicit dates (for example, to accommodate special event services, or a school schedule), this is a good approach.
* Alternate: Omit [calendar.txt](#calendartxt), and include ALL dates of service in calendar_dates.txt. If your schedule varies most days of the month, or you want to programmatically output service dates without specifying a normal weekly schedule, this approach may be preferable.

|  Field Name | Required | Details |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  service_id | **Required** | The **service_id** contains an ID that uniquely identifies a set of dates when a service exception is available for one or more routes. Each (service_id, date) pair can only appear once in calendar_dates.txt. If the a service_id value appears in both the calendar.txt and calendar_dates.txt files, the information in calendar_dates.txt modifies the service information specified in [calendar.txt](#calendartxt). This field is referenced by the [trips.txt](#tripstxt) file. |
|  date | **Required** | The **date** field specifies a particular date when service availability is different than the norm. You can use the **exception_type** field to indicate whether service is available on the specified date. The **date** field's value should be in YYYYMMDD format. |
|  exception_type | **Required** | The **exception_type** indicates whether service is available on the date specified in the date field. |
|   |  |*  A value of **1** indicates that service has been added for the specified date. |
|   |  |* A value of **2** indicates that service has been removed for the specified date. |
|   |  | For example, suppose a route has one set of trips available on holidays and another set of trips available on all other days. You could have one **service_id** that corresponds to the regular service schedule and another **service_id** that corresponds to the holiday schedule. For a particular holiday, you would use the calendar_dates.txt file to add the holiday to the holiday **service_id** and to remove the holiday from the regular **service_id** schedule. |
