File: **Required**

|  Field Name | Required | Details |  |  |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  stop_id | **Required** | The **stop_id** field contains an ID that uniquely identifies a stop, station, or station entrance. Multiple routes may use the same stop. The **stop_id** is used by systems as an internal identifier of this record (e.g., primary key in database), and therefore the **stop_id** must be dataset unique.  |  |  |
|  stop_code | Optional | The **stop_code** field contains short text or a number that uniquely identifies the stop for passengers. Stop codes are often used in phone-based transit information systems or printed on stop signage to make it easier for riders to get a stop schedule or real-time arrival information for a particular stop.  The **stop_code** field contains short text or a number that uniquely identifies the stop for passengers. The **stop_code** can be the same as **stop_id** if it is passenger-facing. This field should be left blank for stops without a code presented to passengers. |  |  |
|  stop_name | **Required** | The **stop_name** field contains the name of a stop, station, or station entrance. Please use a name that people will understand in the local and tourist vernacular. |  |  |
|  stop_desc | Optional | The **stop_desc** field contains a description of a stop. Please provide useful, quality information. Do not simply duplicate the name of the stop. |  |  |
|  stop_lat | **Required** | The **stop_lat** field contains the latitude of a stop, station, or station entrance. The field value must be a valid WGS 84 latitude. |  |  |
|  stop_lon | **Required** | The **stop_lon** field contains the longitude of a stop, station, or station entrance. The field value must be a valid WGS 84 longitude value from -180 to 180. |  |  |
|  zone_id | Optional | The **zone_id** field defines the fare zone for a stop ID. Zone IDs are required if you want to provide fare information using [fare_rules.txt](#fare_rulestxt). If this stop ID represents a station, the zone ID is ignored. |  |  |
|  stop_url | Optional | The **stop_url** field contains the URL of a web page about a particular stop. This should be different from the agency_url and the route_url fields.  The value must be a fully qualified URL that includes **http**:// or **https**://, and any special characters in the URL must be correctly escaped. See http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html for a description of how to create fully qualified URL values. |  |  |
|  location_type | Optional | The **location_type** field identifies whether this stop ID represents a stop, station, or station entrance. If no location type is specified, or the location_type is blank, stop IDs are treated as stops. Stations may have different properties from stops when they are represented on a map or used in trip planning.  The location type field can have the following values: |  |  |
|   |  | * **0** or blank - Stop. A location where passengers board or disembark from a transit vehicle. |  |  |
|   |  | * **1** - Station. A physical structure or area that contains one or more stop. |  |  |
|   |  | * **2** - Station Entrance/Exit. A location where passengers can enter or exit a station from the street. The stop entry must also specify a parent_station value referencing the stop ID of the parent station for the entrance. |  |  |
|  parent_station | Optional | For stops that are physically located inside stations, the **parent_station** field identifies the station associated with the stop. To use this field, stops.txt must also contain a row where this stop ID is assigned location type=1. |  |  |
|   |  | **This stop ID represents...** | **This entry's location type...** | **This entry's parent_station field contains...** |
|   |  | A stop located inside a station. | 0 or blank | The stop ID of the station where this stop is located. The stop referenced by parent_station must have location_type=1. |
|   |  | A stop located outside a station. | 0 or blank | A blank value. The parent_station field doesn't apply to this stop. |
|   |  | A station. | 1 | A blank value. Stations can't contain other stations. |
|  stop_timezone | Optional | The **stop_timezone** field contains the timezone in which this stop, station, or station entrance is located. Please refer to [Wikipedia List of Timezones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) for a list of valid values. If omitted, the stop should be assumed to be located in the timezone specified by **agency_timezone** in [agency.txt](#agencytxt).   When a stop has a parent station, the stop is considered to be in the timezone specified by the parent station's **stop_timezone** value. If the parent has no stop_timezone value, the stops that belong to that station are assumed to be in the timezone specified by **agency_timezone**, even if the stops have their own **stop_timezone** values. In other words, if a given stop has a **parent_station** value, any **stop_timezone** value specified for that stop must be ignored.  Even if **stop_timezone** values are provided in stops.txt, the times in [stop_times.txt](#stop_timestxt) should continue to be specified as time since midnight in the timezone specified by **agency_timezone** in agency.txt. This ensures that the time values in a trip always increase over the course of a trip, regardless of which timezones the trip crosses. |  |  |
|  wheelchair_boarding | Optional | The **wheelchair_boarding field** identifies whether wheelchair boardings are possible from the specified stop, station, or station entrance. The field can have the following values: |  |  |
|   |  | * **0** (or empty) - indicates that there is no accessibility information for the stop |  |  |
|   |  | * **1** - indicates that at least some vehicles at this stop can be boarded by a rider in a wheelchair |  |  |
|   |  | * **2** - wheelchair boarding is not possible at this stop |  |  |
|   |  | When a stop is part of a larger station complex, as indicated by a stop with a **parent_station** value, the stop's **wheelchair_boarding** field has the following additional semantics: |  |  |
|   |  | * **0** (or empty) - the stop will inherit its **wheelchair_boarding** value from the parent station, if specified in the parent |  |  |
|   |  | * **1** - there exists some accessible path from outside the station to the specific stop / platform |  |  |
|   |  | * **2** - there exists no accessible path from outside the station to the specific stop / platform |  |  |
|   |  | For station entrances, the **wheelchair_boarding** field has the following additional semantics: |  |  |
|   |  | * **0** (or empty) - the station entrance will inherit its **wheelchair_boarding** value from the parent station, if specified in the parent |  |  |
|   |  | * **1** - the station entrance is wheelchair accessible (e.g. an elevator is available to platforms if they are not at-grade)  |  |  |
|   |  | * **2** - there exists no accessible path from the entrance to station platforms |  |  |
